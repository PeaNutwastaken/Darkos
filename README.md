See the [ArkOS Wiki](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki) for more information about standard ArkOS and link to images. Information about DarkOS and progress updates will be on the readme

DarkOS is a fork of ArkOS that aims to add a desktop enviroment to ArkOS, I made this fork just for fun so dont expect much from this. :)

Plans (ignore): Add a desktop enviroment, basic apps, and make this as user friendly as possible.
